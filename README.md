# election_analysis

## Project Overview

A Colorado Board of Elections employee had given the following tasks to complete for the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate recieved.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources

- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.8.5, Visual Studio Code, 1.50.1

## Challenge Overview
 The challenge really helped solidify my understanding of the code I was writing and what it did. The syntax was new and took some getting used to but eventually it started to feel natural. The small pieces started to come together. I ran into errors and I persevered, I solved them and got it done.
## Challenge Summary
The challenge was similar to the module practice, we added more data of each county and county votes as well as the candidates and their votes. I really started to see how some small additions to the code can have some very powerful impacts on the results.
## Use Case Proposals
Ths script can be used for many future elections with slight modifications. Simple variable changes or variable additions for added rows of data in your CSV file. In this case the script was used to find the total vote counts, county vote counts, the elected winner, all that as well as the percentages of each count. This script can go beyond measuring county data, it can be altered to find, state data, city data, or even votes cast by gender or race.
